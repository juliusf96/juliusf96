# Hi, I'm Julius 👋 I like tackling weird problems.

I build things that solve real problems in the physical world and I use code as the fastest way to make those ideas real.

I'm not obsessed with "writing code for code’s sake."
I'm obsessed with getting difficult stuff to actually work.

### 🔭 What I'm working on

**♻ Circular resource systems**  
Helping organisations understand what they already have, what can be reused instead of thrown away, and what that means in terms of cost and environmental impact.  
Full-stack work: data modeling, backend, frontend, product thinking.  
Goal: make circular economy actually practical, not just a slide in a report.

**🏙 Street-level city intelligence**  
Exploring geospatial tools that turn urban data into decisions.  
Signals like rent vs price behavior, risk, location context, and infrastructure, all shown in a way normal humans can use.  
Goal: give people insider context without needing to be an insider.

### 🧠 How I work
- I like hard, messy, real-world problems.
- I move between product, data, backend, and frontend instead of staying in one lane.
- I care more about outcomes than hype.
- I will absolutely duct-tape five boring tools together if it means we ship something useful today.

If you're looking for “I’ll figure it out and make it work,” that’s me.
